# Medium_Titles_Clustering
Using the Medium titles dataset from Kaggle, I develop an alternative solution for Medium "Related Articles" feature on both PC and mobile.

I utilize the data-science-related Medium datase provided by Kaggle[https://www.kaggle.com/zackakil/medium-article-titles] to conduct the title clustering analyitcs. And based on my result, I suggest a newer version of recommender system for the related article features at the end of every post.

I have put down my thinking process and execution plan at my Medium post.[https://towardsdatascience.com/user-guide-to-my-first-data-product-medium-post-metric-displayer-e99e74e52b3a]
